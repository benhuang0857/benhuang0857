* ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ben Huang.I'm currently work in Micron and my position is MES IT.
* :writing_hand: In Micron work. I usually use ASP, Python and VueJs. But I like laravel lot. And so I did side-project most use laravel framework. If you also feel coding should not be too many prepare steps, too hard background knowledge and too many dependency. You should try laravel first. So great.
* ðŸŒ± I love coding and like learning new skill. Recently, I love C/C++ and use them in customize my own FreeRTOS then porting.
